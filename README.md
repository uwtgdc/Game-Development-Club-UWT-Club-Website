Whatever else we feel like adding..

# Issues
Established but empty routes, location, projects, and contact buttons now
go to their own unique pages. Please note though these routes are set they
do not HAVE to go to what they are called. After WebDev team looks over the
changes we can discuss what we want them to go to.

Still many placeholder texts/links.

Footer is established but a bit messy.
