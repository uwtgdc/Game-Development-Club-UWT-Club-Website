    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>UWT Game Development Club is dedicated to the learning and teaching of video game development, both as a hobby and for entrance into the Video Game Industry. Some activities that the Game Development Club hosts include workshops and Game Jam events. The club is also looking to create a group programming project and to host guest speaker events in the future. Come learn with us as we discover how games work, what makes them fun to play, and ultimately, how to make them!

    <h2>A Brief History About the Game Development Club @ UWT</h2>
    <p>The Game Development Club @ UWT started in the 2020-2021 academic year with it’s first meeting ever being held on November 27th, 2020 at 2:00 PM with a goal to create a community where people can come together while being connected by their passions for game development whether by showcasing games or creating friendly competitions. Since then, the club has primarily been meeting weekly or biweekly depending on club membership.
    </p>
  <p>Currently, the club is growing and meets twice a week through General Meetings and Workshop Meetings with a goal both to still create a positive community with a focus of exploring game development. At the same time, the Game Development Club @ UWT has also begun to start creating opportunities for people to learn more and experience how to do any aspect of game development and more about opportunities related to careers in game development and even technology fields.
    </p>
  <p>The club has always focused on the community. From hosting Game Jams and creating community projects to even tabling at UWT Involvement Fairs throughout the years.</p>
